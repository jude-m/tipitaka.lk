# Welcome to the Tipitaka.lk

This website was created to maintain the Buddha Jayanthi Tipitaka (BJT) of Sri Lanka which was prepared by a group of scholar Sri Lankan monks around 1960s and 1970s and published under the patronage of the government of Sri Lanka (Ceylon). BJT consists of 57 books and the scanned PDFs of the original printed volumes are available in the [Tipitaka.lk library](https://tipitaka.lk/library/267). 

### Sri Lanka Tipitaka Project (SLTP)
The BJT texts, consisting of an estimated thirty-five million characters, were keyed in over a period of three years, commencing in 1991 and was completed at the "Sri Vajiragnana Dharmayatanaya," Bhikkhu Training Center, Maharagama, Sri Lanka in 1994.  The project was carried out under the auspices of Venerable Madihe Pagnnaseha Mahanayake Thera, Head of the Amarapura branch of the Buddhist Sangha in Sri Lanka, with financial sponsorship from the Chandraratne family. This semi-proof-read data has been available in many different websites until 2019 when the Tipitaka.lk project was born.

## Proofreading done by Tipitaka.lk

First round by making corrections to the SLTP source files by comparing it with scanned PDFs of BJT manually by both volunteers and paid employees. Initially we used Chaṭṭha Saṃgāyanā Tipiṭaka (CST) available in [Tipitaka.app](https://tipitaka.app/) instead of SLTP as source material. But later we switched to using SLTP as it matched the scanned PDFs better.

Second round by identifying the common errors that occur in printing, reading and typing Sinhala letters and then programmatically identifying potential locations in the text with these errors. All potential errors were then manually checked by volunteers and scholar monks to correct many mistakes in both printing and typesetting

Third round is an ongoing effort to correct the errors reported daily by users of Tipitaka.lk website and its offline apps.

The proofread text is made available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/pathnirvana/tipitaka.lk/tree/master/public/static/text)
